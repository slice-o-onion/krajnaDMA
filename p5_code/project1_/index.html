<h1> Project 1... </h1>
<h2> I was really inspired by the examples from class that I tweaked the brushes provided
  in the template, and eventually made some very unique brushes.
  This was very fun to make, despite technical problems that I encountered while
  making this project. One of my favorites is the Petal brush (Key 7), which
  lets you make red flowers.<br><br>
   I liked this brush a lot because i didn't expect what I was gonna get, and didn't expect for it to work.
   I pretty much used the same rules as the bubble brush(Key 6) and altered it to make arcs instead of ellipses, and instead of making just one arc per mouse press/movement, I made it to use two arcs at the time, one being the bright red one, while the other one is a darker, smaller petal.
  This in turn created a shadow effect, which to me made the flowers I make look more visually intersting than if all the arcs had the same color.
  <br><br>
  This then inspired me to use the same "shadow" technique in my Dragon brush (Key 8), so it can have a double-color on its fins.

<p> (<strong>Here are the brushes included in my project:</strong>)

  <br>
Hit:
<br> Key "1" for a thin black line.
<br>Key "2" for a thin red line.
<br> Key "3" for a double-color brush, influenced by X-Y coordinates.
<br> Key "4" for a thin red bubble line, influenced by X-Y coordinates.
<br> Key "5" to use the eraser.
<br> Key "6" for a Ratatouille-themed bubble brush!
<br> Key "7" to make chrysanthemums.
<br> Key "8" to start making your own <strong>dragon</strong> :)
<br> Key "x" to erase the canvas.
<br> Key "p" to save your own creations!
<br><br> tip: to change the color of the stroke on brushes 3, 4, or 6, use keys 1 or 2 beforehand).
