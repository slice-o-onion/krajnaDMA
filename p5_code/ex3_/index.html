  <h1>"Bumblebee Dance"</h1>

  <h2> This project was a little challenging to me, mainly because I had a hard time understanding the "push()" and "pop()" functions. I was iintimidated by the way the coding was set up,becuase now I have to make sure that I set up the rules right or else every character's legs or arms will be messed up. Eventually, I got the hang of it, and I am pretty glad about the end result.
    <br> I ended up with four delightful wiggling characters dancing with a skip in their step!
