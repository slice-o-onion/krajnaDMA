  <h1> Exercise 1 </h1>

  <h2> This project was pretty easy to me, I had the least technical issues whilst making this.
  The only problem I had while coding this piece was figuring out how the "sin()" and "console.log" functions worked.
  As for my color and design choices I always make it a point to make a vibrant, colorful piece.
  <br><br> I had a lot of fun making this, and was also pretty delighted at the fact that I can interact with it by making an interactive function in the design (the blue-cyan rectangles) that follow the viewer's mouse in the canvas. In this way, the viewer can take part in adding onto the art in this piece.
