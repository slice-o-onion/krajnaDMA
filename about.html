							I am Krajna Alcantara (pronounced "cray-ee-na"), a Digital Media Artist currently attending San Jose State University.
							 I'm a Filipino immigrant born in a rural city Batangas, Philippines and immigrated with my family in Daly City.
							 I come from a photography background in highschool and
							 took some Art History and Photography classes at Skyline community college at San Bruno.
							 	<br></br>
							I firmly believe in Bob Ross's quote: "There are no mistakes, only happy accidents."
							I love experimenting with my work, which oftentimes leads me to unconventional angles in an artpiece and giving them an edge, like my artworks made from
							my <a href="codework.html"> brush code pieces</a>, <a href="3dworks.html"> 3D artworks</a>,
							and my <em>Liquify</em>-based <a href="digitalworks.html"> Digital Art</a>.
								<br></br>
								Most of my work is 2D, but I want to develop my 3D skills and develop 3D games, 3D art, and maybe even some
								3D animations. My goal is to further increase my knowledge in other forms of art so that I have more assets added onto my knowledge to further experiment and
								hopefully work in a company as a lead artist or designer, or even have my work displayed in museums!
								<br></br>
								  In addition,
								 I'm interested in learning about 3D printing and learning about AR and VR using my knowledge in 3D art as a base.
