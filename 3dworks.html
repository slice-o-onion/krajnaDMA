			<h2> Series: <em>Creatures of the Subconscious</em></h2>
				<h2> Made: Fall 2022(Art74 Final)</h2>
			<div>
		<br>
				<strong> Using the 3D sculpting website,<a href="https://stephaneginier.com/sculptgl/">stephaneginier.com</a>,
					I made a few works from my Art 74 class. I really loved the versatility the online web editing tool allowed me.
					 After I input the 3D models into Procreate, I found out that I could wrap the objects with my own design.
					 I decided to make a series of creatures that one could encounter while dreaming.
				  Some of my finished products have used some of the artworks I included in my<a href="digitalworks.html"> Digital Art</a>
					section, such as in "Lucid","Paralysis", and "Recurring, Falling."

				  <br></br>
				<em>	"The Creatures of the Subconscious"</em> series present the creations that
					I have made in regards to occurences that one may encounter in their dreams.
					Some may be in possession of having multiple episodes of the same dream.
					 Some may be having trouble escaping their nightmarish dream,
						encountering paralysis in their sleep. According to Freud, your dreams reveal your repressed wishes to you.
					But what if these wishes are misconstrued by your own subconscious?
					 Here, I present Lucidity, Prophet, Repeat, Discord, and Paralysis, some of the creatures I have gathered from my
					 own consciousness that are willing to introduce themselves for the good of its visitors.

				<strong><h2>"Recurring,Falling."</h2>

		<p> <i>Repeat</i>, a spawn with several siblings, can drive you insane. He is lazy, and can loop you round and round the previous dreams you have already had. But he is more helpful than <i>Prophet</i>, for while he presents himself lax on the surface, he is actually trying to make sure you understand that the previous dreams you had have some significance. Is he trying to make you find an important detail? Or is this his way to make fun of you? I asked him a few times, but every time I asked the question, I got a feeling that I've asked the question just a minute ago. Oh, and he randomly told me that he is bad at hide-and-seek. Maybe he just wants help finding his other siblings, because the dream realm is far more vast and confusing than the mortal plane.

					<strong><h2>"Discord."</h2>

				<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/654397297?h=4525f6c150" width="782" height="782" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<div>
					<p>
					Discord is a dream of chaos, and she knows it. She can instantly make you appear before Repeat if you get tempted, who she knows will make you help him find his other siblings for him. Discord knows that the game has been over a long time ago now, and has since vanished into the mortal plane, where people catch them and contain them in little ornaments. Discord is two-faced to the point that one of Repeat's siblings has been absorbed into her own body, and additionally gaining the ability to track down Repeat's whereabouts. Avoid her at all costs.

<h2>Lucid.</h2>

<div>
	<p>
		A lucid dream is a type of dream where the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming. During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, or environment; however, this is not actually necessary for a dream to be described as lucid. While this may be a good thing, it is crucial that when you meet Lucidity, you should keep thinking of positive and lively thoughts, because this creature can sense fear and resentment, and can easily leave you to Paralysis.

				<strong><h2>"Prophetic"</h2>
			</div>
			<div>

				<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/654399286?h=28a44fbbab" width="782" height="782" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<p>
				Prophet has been around for quite some time. Some say it is the cause of many wars, as there are so much of humanity that relies on it.
				The truth is, it is kind of mischievous.
				 I suggest you think twice before you trust it, because it knows your weakest points, and if you are not nice to Prophet,
				it will give you the answer you want, while knowing it is not the truth.

			<strong><h2>"Paralysis"</h2>
			</div>
			<div>
					<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/654400579?h=f58a02984d" width="782" height="782" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Vivid dream-like experiences, referred to as hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, can seem real and are often frightening. They may be mistaken for nightmares, and they can occur while you’re falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking up (hypnopompic). During these hallucinations, you may see scary people or creatures near you or even lying in your bed. And they’re often accompanied by sleep paralysis. Paralysis actually comprises of two entities, one a spirit, and the other a projection of your most feared demon in your bedroom, a reality only augmented by the Eye Spirit. Do not fear, Paralysis only aims to be alone, so I suggest you do not open your eyes when you are entranced by the Eye Spirit, or you will meet their other half.
