			<h2>"Brush" Works</h2>
			<div>

				<h1> Project 1... </h1>
				<strong> I was really inspired by the examples from class that I tweaked the brushes provided
				  in the template, and eventually made some very unique brushes.
				  This was very fun to make, despite technical problems that I encountered while
				  making this project. One of my favorites is the Petal brush (Key 7), which
				  lets you make red flowers.<br><br>
				   I liked this brush a lot because i didn't expect what I was gonna get, and didn't expect for it to work.
				   I pretty much used the same rules as the bubble brush(Key 6) and altered it to make arcs instead of ellipses, and instead of making just one arc per mouse press/movement, I made it to use two arcs at the time, one being the bright red one, while the other one is a darker, smaller petal.
				  This in turn created a shadow effect, which to me made the flowers I make look more visually intersting than if all the arcs had the same color.
